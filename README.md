## üì¶ Installation

### From Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/pulsepoint/pulsepoint.git
cd pulsepoint

# Build the binary
make build

# Install to system (optional)
make install
```

### Binary Releases

Download the latest release for your platform from the [releases page](https://github.com/pulsepoint/pulsepoint/releases).

```bash
# Linux/macOS
chmod +x pulsepoint
sudo mv pulsepoint /usr/local/bin/

# Verify installation
pulsepoint --version
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Initialize Configuration

```bash
pulsepoint init
```

This creates a configuration file at `~/.pulsepoint/config.yaml`.

### 2. Authenticate with Google Drive

First, set up Google Cloud credentials:
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the Google Drive API
4. Create OAuth2 credentials (Desktop application type)
5. Download the credentials JSON file

Then authenticate PulsePoint:

**üìñ See [Google Drive Setup Guide](docs/GOOGLE_DRIVE_SETUP.md) for detailed instructions.**

Quick setup:
```bash
# Run the interactive setup script
./scripts/setup-google-auth.sh

# Then authenticate
pulsepoint auth google
```

Alternative methods:
```bash
# Using credentials file
pulsepoint auth google --credentials /path/to/credentials.json

# Or using environment variables
export GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="your-client-id"
export GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="your-client-secret"
pulsepoint auth google
```

### 3. Start Syncing

```bash
# One-time sync
pulsepoint sync /path/to/local/folder

# Continuous monitoring and sync
pulsepoint pulse /path/to/local/folder

# With specific sync strategy
pulsepoint sync /path/to/folder --strategy mirror

# Dry run to preview changes
pulsepoint sync /path/to/folder --dry-run
```

## üìñ Commands

```

### Sync Options

```bash
# Sync strategies
pulsepoint sync /path --strategy one-way    # Local to remote only (default)
pulsepoint sync /path --strategy mirror     # Exact copy, delete extras
pulsepoint sync /path --strategy backup     # Preserve all versions

# Conflict resolution
pulsepoint sync /path --conflict keep-local   # Local wins (default)
pulsepoint sync /path --conflict keep-remote  # Remote wins
pulsepoint sync /path --conflict keep-both    # Rename conflicts
pulsepoint sync /path --conflict skip         # Skip conflicts

# Other options

pulsepoint sync /path --full       # Full sync instead of incremental
pulsepoint sync /path --dry-run    # Preview without making changes
pulsepoint sync /path --workers 8  # Number of concurrent workers
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

PulsePoint uses a layered configuration system:

1. **Default Configuration** (built-in)
2. **System Configuration** (`/etc/pulsepoint/config.yaml`)
3. **User Configuration** (`~/.pulsepoint/config.yaml`)
4. **Environment Variables** (PULSEPOINT_*)
5. **Command-line Flags** (highest priority)

### Configuration File Example

```yaml
# ~/.pulsepoint/config.yaml

# Sync configuration
sync:
  interval: 5m
  batch_size: 100
  max_concurrent: 4
  retry_attempts: 3
  retry_delay: 2s
  conflict_resolution: keep-local

# File handling
files:
  max_file_size: 1073741824  # 1GB
  preserve_timestamps: true
  preserve_permissions: false
  ignore_patterns:
    - "*.tmp"
    - "*.cache"
    - ".DS_Store"
    - "Thumbs.db"

# Provider configuration
providers:
  google:
    configured: true
    credentials_file: ~/.pulsepoint/credentials/google_credentials.json
    token_file: ~/.pulsepoint/tokens/google_token.json
    simple_upload_threshold: 5242880      # 5MB
    resumable_upload_threshold: 104857600 # 100MB

```

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Authentication
export GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="your-client-id"
export GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="your-client-secret"
export GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_FILE="/path/to/credentials.json"
export GOOGLE_TOKEN_FILE="/path/to/token.json"

# PulsePoint configuration
export PULSEPOINT_CONFIG="/custom/config.yaml"
export PULSEPOINT_LOG_LEVEL="debug"
export PULSEPOINT_DB_PATH="/custom/db/path.db"
```

## üìÅ File Ignore Patterns

PulsePoint supports `.gitignore`-style patterns for excluding files from sync:

### .pulseignore File

Create a `.pulseignore` file in your sync directory:

```gitignore
# Temporary files
*.tmp
*.cache
*.swp
*~

# OS files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
desktop.ini

# Development
node_modules/
.git/
.venv/
__pycache__/
*.pyc

# Sensitive files
.env
secrets.yaml
*.key
*.pem

# Large files
*.iso
*.dmg
*.zip
*.tar.gz

# Custom patterns
build/
dist/
logs/
```

## üéØ Sync Strategies

### One-Way Sync (Default)
- Syncs files from local to remote only
- Remote changes are not pulled down
- Best for: Backup scenarios, publishing workflows

### Mirror Sync
- Creates an exact copy in the remote
- Deletes remote files not present locally
- Best for: Exact replicas, deployment scenarios

### Backup Sync
- Never deletes any files
- Preserves all versions
- Best for: Archival, version preservation

## ‚öîÔ∏è Conflict Resolution

PulsePoint automatically detects and resolves conflicts:

| Strategy | Description | Use Case |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `keep-local` | Local version wins | Development work |
| `keep-remote` | Remote version wins | Collaboration |
| `keep-both` | Rename and keep both | Important files |
| `skip` | Skip conflicted files | Manual review |

## üìä Performance

PulsePoint is optimized for performance:

- **Concurrent Operations**: Parallel uploads/downloads
- **Smart Batching**: Groups small files for efficiency
- **Delta Sync**: Only syncs changed portions (coming in v2)
- **Caching**: Metadata caching reduces API calls
- **Rate Limiting**: Respects API quotas automatically

### Performance Tuning

```yaml
# For large file sets
sync:
  batch_size: 500
  max_concurrent: 8

# For slow networks
providers:
  google:
    chunk_size: 4194304  # 4MB chunks
    max_retries: 5
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Authentication Failed
```bash
# Check credentials
pulsepoint auth google --status

# Re-authenticate
pulsepoint auth google --revoke
pulsepoint auth google
```

#### Sync Not Working
```bash
# Check logs
pulsepoint logs

# Enable debug logging
pulsepoint sync /path --verbose

# Verify file patterns
cat .pulseignore
```

#### Permission Errors
```bash
# Check file permissions
ls -la ~/.pulsepoint/

# Fix permissions
chmod 700 ~/.pulsepoint
chmod 600 ~/.pulsepoint/tokens/*
```

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging for troubleshooting:

```bash
# Command-line
pulsepoint sync /path -v

# Environment
export PULSEPOINT_LOG_LEVEL=debug

# Configuration
logging:
  level: debug
```

## üîê Security

PulsePoint prioritizes security:

- **Token Security**: Tokens stored with 0600 permissions
- **No Credential Logging**: Sensitive data never logged
- **OAuth2 Standards**: Full RFC 6749 compliance
- **State Validation**: CSRF protection in OAuth flow
- **Encrypted Storage**: Token encryption at rest

## üß™ Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
# All tests
make test

# Unit tests only
make test-unit

# Integration tests
make test-integration

# With coverage
make test-coverage
```

## üìà Monitoring

Monitor PulsePoint operations:

```bash
# Current status
pulsepoint status

# Statistics
pulsepoint status --stats

# Watch mode
watch -n 5 pulsepoint status
```
